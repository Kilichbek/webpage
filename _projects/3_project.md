The idea behind creating this project is to explore the intersection of technology and human experience, specifically the dream state. Dreams are a unique and subjective experience, and this project seeks to use AI and visual art to represent and interpret them in a new way. By using EEG/EOG signals to predict sleep stages and generate the particle system, we aim to create a visual representation of the dream state that is both grounded in science and open to artistic interpretation. The project also seeks to explore the idea of the subconscious mind and the ways in which our thoughts and emotions can manifest in our dreams. Ultimately, the project aims to create a mesmerizing and immersive experience that allows users to explore the depths of their own minds in a new and exciting way.

Our project, Dream Flow , was inspired by Refik Anadol's "Melting Memories" installation. We were fascinated by the idea of using brain signals to create dynamic and immersive art, and we wanted to explore this concept further using AI and 3D particles.
